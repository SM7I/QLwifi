# RetroCom for ZXpand+ Super Serial card

ZX81 and ZX80 computers can also utilize the wonders of Internet if equipped with ZXpand+ interface by Charlie Robson (sirmorris).
By connecting the Super Serial card, which can be purchased by me, Internet is in reach.
The Super Serial card has the following features:
* ESP-01 industrial wifi module
* 5 pin DIN MIDI connector
* Joystick port
